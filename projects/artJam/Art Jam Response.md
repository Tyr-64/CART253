\
I really enjoyed all of what I saw. Pansy and Sama's portraits took a
similar symbolic approach but with very different results while Ahmad's
was more representative and had a bit more of a narrative.\
\
All of them opted to use the mouse as an input method. This works to
their favor I think; the mouse is the most dynamic easily implementable
input method and our (instilled) intuitive understanding of it makes it
easy to use it for play. I think Ahmad's is probably the least effective
use of the mouse simply because the narrative of night and day doesn't
really tie in to the hand very well. You can wave the hand around but it
almost gives it less weight than I'd want, it just feels like a paper
cutout. In fairness it basically is. This, plus that lack of narrative
relevance (as far as I can tell) makes the hand feel superfluous. I
think adding some sense of visual physicality to the mouse controls can
help to give it more weight, making it more tactile to use and in turn
affecting its place in the narrative. Pansy and Sama's projects do this
a bit better: Pansy's Pansy has depth thanks to its shading, meanwhile
Sama's ascii coverup feels like pushing away sand to reveal an image
underneath, especially thanks to the wide radius around the mouse
(otherwise it'd feel like tedious scratching). Ahmad's project does
better here too, the way you control the pupils is well integrated and
as a result feels more fun to play with by making expressions. By giving
the user something to contend with (the eyes closing) and making it part
of the overall narrative it feels much more relevant to what's going on
in the piece. In all these cases I think the mouse controls feel like
they have a more tangible relationship to what's going on, either
through physicality or limitations that the user has to consider.\
\
Regarding each piece as a broader narrative statement- I think they're
all neat! This is a simple project and they all delivered well. Ahmad's
piece establishes a clear narrative, I think the most compelling thing I
get from it is thanks to the eyes. I like the idea of an otherwise
linear loop being affected in small ways by the user, but which go on to
affect the framing of the narrative in significant ways. Pansy and
Sama's projects are more similar in that they both focus on a single
symbol, but each offers a different way of interacting with it. They're
honestly really fun to compare for this reason, and their abstraction
allows more room for interpretation from an otherwise simple project.
Pansy's feels more playful, like more of a celebration (note that I was
listening to music while playing it- its never not fun to bob an image
around to music with a mouse). Meanwhile Sama's is a bit drier. It has
nice visual flair thanks to the ASCII but once the image is revealed
there's little else to explore ludically. I'm left wondering what the
relationship is between the 8-Ball, the ASCII, and Sama is. Maybe Sama's
final shot is learning digital media skills, and that will take them to
victory? Or are they the 8-Ball, made up of bits and bytes awash in a
sea of data, waiting to be uncovered? Who's to say. Pansy's is a little
easier to interpret since it feels fairly obvious she's represented
directly by the... pansy. New depth is found through repetition,
infinite compositions folding out from one idea. If you let it, this
thoughtful reflection can fill the space and keep on going.
