## Description

An artistic image manipulation program. Either your webcam or a chosen image scans into view. It becomes less recognizable the more you interact with it.

To use an image simply drag and drop an image file onto the canvas. Supports all letters, spacebar, enter, and some punctuation. Make sure to test the number keys!
